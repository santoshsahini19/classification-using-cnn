# Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

In this project, I worked on basic implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks.

- Performed classification on data set which contains thousands of images of dogs and cats
- I used high level computational libraries like TensorFlow, Keras to build this classification model
- Performed data pre-processing on data to avoid over fitting
- Pre-processed data is fed to convolution neural network (consists of multiple layers)
- CNN is trained on this data with an accuracy of 90%
- This model is tested with a new image to classify it as a dog or cat

(Due to large size of the data set I did not include data in this repository)
